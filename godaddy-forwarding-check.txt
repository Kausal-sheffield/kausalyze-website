CHECK FOR DOMAIN FORWARDING:

1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Go to your domain's (kausalyze.com) management page
3. Look for "Forwarding" or "Domain Forward" settings

   Common locations:
   - Under "Additional Settings"
   - In "DNS Settings" page, sometimes at the top
   - Under "Domain Settings" or "Domain Details"

4. If any forwarding is enabled, disable it completely

Note: Domain forwarding can override your DNS settings and cause your site
to redirect to GoDaddy's servers instead of GitHub Pages, even with correct DNS records.
