CHECK FOR DOMAIN PARKING / COMING SOON SETTINGS:

1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Go to your Domain Manager or Domain Settings
3. Find kausalyze.com in your list of domains
4. Look for settings like:
   - "Domain Parking"
   - "Coming Soon Page"
   - "For Sale Page"
   - "Under Construction"

5. IMPORTANT: These may be located in different places:
   - Sometimes under "Additional Settings"
   - Sometimes in their own tab within domain management
   - Sometimes under "Websites" section

6. Ensure all such features are DISABLED or turned OFF

NOTE: GoDaddy regularly updates their interface, so the exact location
may differ from what you see in online guides. Be thorough in checking
all domain settings sections.
