STEPS TO PUSH YOUR CODE TO GITHUB:

1. Update your package.json:
   - Replace "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username
   - Replace "YOUR_REPO_NAME" with your repository name (e.g., "kausalyze-website")

2. Open terminal/command prompt in your project root folder and run these commands:

# If you haven't already initialized Git in your project
git init

# Add all files to Git
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
# Note: If you get an error with 'main', try using 'master' instead:
# git push -u origin master

3. Once your code is on GitHub, install gh-pages package (if you haven't already):
npm install --save gh-pages

4. Deploy your site to GitHub Pages:
npm run deploy

5. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "gh-pages" branch
   - Your site will be published at: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/

6. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete, then visit your site URL.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If you get a 404 error after deployment, check that your "homepage" URL in package.json exactly matches the GitHub Pages URL
- For routing issues, make sure you've added both the 404.html and updated index.html with the routing scripts
- If files are missing, check that you've committed all changes and pushed them to GitHub before deploying
