STEPS TO PUSH YOUR CODE TO GITHUB:

1. Update your package.json:
   - Replace "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username
   - Replace "YOUR_REPO_NAME" with your repository name (e.g., "kausalyze-website")
   - The "homepage" field should contain your custom domain: "https://kausalyze.com"

2. Open terminal/command prompt in your project root folder and run these commands:

# If you haven't already initialized Git in your project
git init

# Add all files to Git
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Kausal-sheffield/kausalyze-website.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
# Note: If you get an error with 'main', try using 'master' instead:
# git push -u origin master

3. Once your code is on GitHub, install gh-pages package (if you haven't already):
npm install --save gh-pages

4. Deploy your site to GitHub Pages:
npm run deploy

5. Configure GitHub Pages with Custom Domain:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Custom domain", enter: kausalyze.com
   - Click "Save"
   - Check the "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox (it may take up to 24 hours for SSL to be fully configured)

6. Configure your GoDaddy DNS settings:
   - Log in to your GoDaddy account
   - Go to your domain's DNS management section
   - Add A records pointing to GitHub Pages:
     Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.108.153, TTL: 600 seconds
     Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.109.153, TTL: 600 seconds
     Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.110.153, TTL: 600 seconds
     Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.111.153, TTL: 600 seconds
   - Add CNAME record for www subdomain:
     Type: CNAME, Name: www, Value: kausalyze.com, TTL: 1 hour

7. Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours), then visit your site at https://kausalyze.com

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, so your domain might not work immediately
- Use https://dnschecker.org to verify your DNS records are properly configured
- If your custom domain fails to resolve, verify your A records are correctly set in GoDaddy
- For SSL issues, make sure "Enforce HTTPS" is checked in GitHub Pages settings
- If files are missing, check that you've committed all changes and pushed them to GitHub before deploying
