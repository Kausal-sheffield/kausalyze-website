VERIFY GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT:

1. Go to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/Kausal-sheffield/kausalyze-website)

2. Check the deployment status:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab
   - Look for the most recent workflow run
   - Ensure it completed successfully (green checkmark)

3. Verify Pages settings:
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Confirm these settings:
     * Branch: gh-pages
     * Custom domain: kausalyze.com
     * "Enforce HTTPS" is checked
     * Status should say "Your site is published at https://kausalyze.com"

4. Test direct GitHub Pages URL:
   - Try accessing: https://kausal-sheffield.github.io/kausalyze-website
   - If this works but kausalyze.com doesn't, it's definitely a domain configuration issue

5. Check your gh-pages branch:
   - Ensure the branch exists
   - Verify it contains your built website files
   - Confirm there's a CNAME file containing only "kausalyze.com"
